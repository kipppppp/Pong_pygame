# <h1>Pong</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A simple 2 player, or 1 player vs AI pong game. This was made with "Clear Code" on YouTube to refamiliarize myself with python and to begin learning pygame. Utilizes event listeners to allow the user to use the following keys(w, s, Kup, Kdown) to move the appropriate paddle up or down. Uses collisions to reverse the travel of the ball.
